                              // ****Above are copies******
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

const team = players;

console.log (players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
// team[3] = 'Lux'; //lux overwrites poppy in the original arrays arrays are references not copies

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
const team2 = players.slice(); //this copies

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
const team3 = [].concat(players); //this concats the old array into the new array effectively copying

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players]; //this takes every single item out of something that is iterable ie: can be looped through and adds the items 1 at a time into the arry. spreads can also be used to spread into functions
                          //spread also copies
const team5 = Array.from(players) //another copy option

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects 
            //It's also true that you cannot use set a new obj equal to an old obj and just change properties to create a new similar object
            //setting a new object equal to an old object and updating the new object will change the value in both objects because it's a reference not a copy
const person = {
name: 'kevin',
age: 493
};

// const captain = person;
// captain.number = 99;

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, color:'blue', age: 22}) //parameters (blankobject, the object you want to copy properties from, properties to update)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
console.log(cap2, person);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //theres a function online to clone deeper into the object

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //poorman's deepclone
    //JSON.parse will turn a string into an object
    //JSON.stringify will turn an object into a string
